# Hi, I’m Uma Vybhavi 👋

I’m an aspiring data analyst with an IT support background, currently building my analytics skills through hands-on projects. I genuinely enjoy cleaning messy data, finding patterns, and explaining insights in a simple, clear way.

Right now, I’m looking for an entry-level / junior data analyst role where I can learn fast and contribute with real work.
